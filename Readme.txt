This program takes experimental findings of grain boundary evolutions from different scientists working on dissimilar samples.
It creates a record of every entry.  It also calculates the best suitable specimen submitted to the database up to date. 

It has two window forms. First shows a list of participants with their grain boundary details. Because the best suitable 
sample is based on minimum energy, the highest solidification factor normalized with thermal gradient. Sample on top of 
the list competes with other specimens according to this formula and must be used in component casting techniques.

Data entry must be with a valid numerical range. Please follow the instructions accordingly. 
If the package is moved to another system, ensure that the database file path is adjusted correctly.
